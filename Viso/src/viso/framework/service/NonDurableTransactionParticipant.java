 * store any persistent state that it needs.  Because these participants do not
 * need to make any persistent changes on commit or abort, the transaction
 * coordinator is not required to inform these participants of the status of a
 * prepared transaction if it can be certain that the participant has crashed.
 * Transaction coordinators can use this information to optimize their
 * implementation of the two phase commit protocol.
