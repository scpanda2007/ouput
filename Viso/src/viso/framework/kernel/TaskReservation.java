 * the tasks will never run. The reservation may be cancelled if it has not
 * yet been run, and no cost will be charged to the owner.
 * <p>
 * If this reservation includes tasks scheduled to be run at a specified time,
 * and that time has already passed when <code>use</code> is called, then
 * the tasks are run immediately.
