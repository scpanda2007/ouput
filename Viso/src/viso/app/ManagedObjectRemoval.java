/**
 * An interface that managed objects should implement in order to be notified

 * DataManager#removeObject DataManager.removeObject} method is called on an
 * object that implements this interface, that method will first call {@link
 * #removingObject removingObject} before removing the object from the data
 * manager.  Managed objects containing references to other managed objects
 * that should be removed when the main object is removed can implement the
 * {@code removingObject} method to remove those referred-to objects.  The
 * {@code removingObject} method will not be called if this object has already
 * been removed or is not currently managed by the data manager. <p>
 *
 * Note that the implementation of {@code removingObject} should make sure that
 * it only removes objects that are logically "owned" by the main object, and
 * that objects are not removed more than once.  In particular, the
 * implementation should not call {@code DataManager.removeObject} on the main
 * object itself.
